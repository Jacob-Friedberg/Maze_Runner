pattern1
    - pattern1 is a singleton pattern
      intended to make sure that there
      is only one of the cube it is
      attached to
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
pattern2
    - pattern2 is an iterater pattern.
      I chose this pattern because it
      was easy to implement and didn't
      interfere with existing code

static_binding
    - This file overwrites the complain
      function from the dynamic_binding
      file to say "I mean its not that bad"
      when the function is called
      this is also used to overwrite the 
      output from the dynamic_binding file
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
dynamic_binding
    - This file outputs "I am here to
    complain about requirements" when
    its complain function is called
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Required
    - This file calls the static_binding
      and dynamic_binding complian functions
      to produce the differing outputs due to
      static and dynamic binding
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
hit_controller
    - This script resides within the player
      and watches for the controller to collide
      with certain objects in the game. Once it
      detects what object it has collided with it
      changes the scene to the one associated with
      the tag and places the player at the correct
      position. This script had to reside inside
      the player prefab because the player was the
      only thing that could change the scene while
      the game was running.
